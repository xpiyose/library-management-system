#Task 1 Data Structures Implementation

#Initialize two data structures to keep track of books and members  both represented as lists
books = [] 
members = []

# The system features two functions (You must create these functions): add_book and add_member. The add_book 
#function takes three parameters (book_id, title, author, status) and appends a new book dictionary to 
#the books list. The add_member function, on the other hand, requires two parameters (member_id, 
#name) and appends a new member dictionary to the members list.

        'Book Title':title,
        'Book Author':author,
        'Book Status':status
    })

#Each member dictionary includes an empty list for borrowed_books to track the IDs of books each member has borrowed.
